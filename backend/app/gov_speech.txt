 Opening:  
This debate fundamentally asks whether social media’s net impact on society is destructive or beneficial. At stake is how we weigh the risks of misinformation, mental health crises, and societal polarization against any claimed benefits like connectivity or free expression.

Framing & Burdens:  
We frame this debate through the lens of societal harm—measuring social media’s aggregate damage to mental wellbeing, democracy, and social cohesion. Our burden is to prove that the negative consequences are both severe and systemic enough to outweigh any positives. The opposition must show not only benefits but that these benefits surpass the scale and scope of harms we expose. This makes their job harder because benefits like “connection” are vague and easily undermined by concrete harms like rising suicide rates and fractured democracies.

Contention One: Social Media Amplifies Misinformation, Undermining Democracy  
Premise: Social media’s algorithms prioritize engagement over truth, spreading misinformation faster and further than any traditional media.  
Links: Platforms use addictive designs—algorithms that reward outrage and sensationalism—creating echo chambers where falsehoods thrive unchecked. This has directly enabled events like the Capitol riot in 2021, where social media-fueled conspiracy theories mobilized violent insurrectionists. It also erodes trust in democratic institutions by overwhelming citizens with contradictory “facts,” fueling polarization and apathy.  
Weighing: The damage to democracy is existential and immediate—once trust breaks down, democratic collapse accelerates. The scale is massive, affecting millions daily and destabilizing entire nations’ governance, making this harm enormously greater in magnitude and urgency than the opposition’s vague claims about connectivity.  
Pre-empt: The opposition might argue social media democratizes information access, but unrestricted access is meaningless if the information is false or weaponized. Access without accuracy is chaos, which we prove dominates this space.

Contention Two: Social Media Fuels a Mental Health Crisis, Especially Among Youth  
Premise: Social media use causes widespread anxiety, depression, and self-harm, particularly among teenagers and young adults.  
Links: The constant stream of idealized images and relentless social comparison triggers feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. Suicide rates among young people have surged in the last decade, correlating strongly with the rise of platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The dopamine-driven feedback loops make it addictive, trapping users in cycles of negative reinforcement. This is not hypothetical; hospitals report increases in self-harm and mental health admissions linked to social media use.  
Weighing: The damage is immediate and personal—millions suffer daily harm, with long-term consequences on future generations’ productivity and wellbeing. The opposition’s best response would be to highlight social connection, but connection that destroys self-worth is no connection at all. This harm is direct, measurable, and irreversible on a societal scale.

Contention Three: Social Media Degrades Social Cohesion and Civil Discourse  
Premise: Social media promotes tribalism, outrage, and polarization, tearing apart communities and undermining social trust.  
Links: The design encourages identity politics and conflict; people cluster in homogeneous online groups, demonizing outsiders. This reflects in rising hate crimes, increased political violence, and the breakdown of meaningful dialogue offline. The pandemic showed this sharply as social media amplified skepticism about masks and vaccines, deepening divisions with deadly consequences.  
Weighing: The harm to social fabric and public health is both immediate and systemic, making peaceful coexistence and collective action nearly impossible. The opposition’s argument about global connectivity fails here because the “connections” are often toxic and destructive. The scale and depth of this fracture make social media a net societal poison.

Conclusion:  
The heart of this debate is whether social media’s dangerous side effects—destroying democracy, fueling a mental health epidemic, and fracturing society—can be outweighed by its claimed benefits. We prove they cannot. These harms are massive in scale, immediate in impact, and threaten the very foundations of free societies and individual wellbeing. The opposition cannot overcome our evidence of social media as a catalyst for misinformation, mental health crises, and social breakdown. Therefore, this House must affirm that social media does more harm than good.
