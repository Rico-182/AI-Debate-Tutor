You have the choice between a job in which you will make a lot of money and work long hours (e.g., investment banker, corporate lawyer, etc.) and a job which pays less but that you are more passionate about (e.g.: social worker, chef, teacher, small business owner, etc). This house would choose the job they are passionate about\n\n\nContent: \n\nThe most heinous crime in human existence was never a single war or any single act of violence. It isn\u2019t even one event. The worst crime happens every single day \u2014 when the boy who dreamed of becoming a teacher grudgingly chooses to go to medical school, when a lawyer sits back in her office and wonders what would have happened if she had chosen to cook, when we look at who we are and who we became, the people we left behind, and remember the day we killed our own dreams because society told us to. That is the world we oppose. Inside government, I have three points of framing before I move into my arguments. First, in both worlds there\u2019s a guarantee of success. We\u2019re talking about a talented, middle-class individual who is capable of succeeding in any field \u2014 whether doctor, lawyer, or teacher.",

We\u2019re talking about a talented, middle-class individual who is capable of succeeding in any field \u2014 whether doctor, lawyer, or teacher. In both worlds, you\u2019ll still likely be able to pay bills, send kids to school, and put food on the table. In our world, you might not have every luxury, but you\u2019ll maintain stability and middle-class comfort. Second, we\u2019re talking about individuals aged twenty to thirty \u2014 the defining decade of life. It\u2019s the period that sets your trajectory, one you can\u2019t rewind. This debate is therefore binary: once you choose a path, you likely stay in it. Third, what does each world look like? On their side, you earn more but work long hours in competitive, high-pressure fields like law or finance. You exert enormous effort but may not feel fulfillment. You make money, yes, but the work feels empty. On our side, you earn less, but you do something you love \u2014 something you once dreamed about, something that gives your life meaning. The burden in this debate is simple: which side creates a happier, more fulfilled life \u2014 both now and in the long term. I\u2019ll advance three arguments:\nWhy passion makes people happy. Why money fails to create lasting happiness. Why we build better relationships.",

Why money fails to create lasting happiness. Why we build better relationships. **Arg 1: Why Passion Makes People Happy**\nThe value of life is measured by experience. Everyone agrees that life is limited, so if you spend most of it doing something you dislike \u2014 trapped in an office, drained by meaningless work \u2014 that\u2019s a subpar existence. In our world, you get fulfillment from your job because you\u2019re doing what you truly want. That happiness is not conditional on success or failure. Whether you\u2019re teaching a kid or acting on stage, you\u2019re happy simply because you\u2019re doing what you love. That joy also materializes as memories. The happiness that comes from money fluctuates \u2014 bad investments, inflation, or theft can take it away. But memories of meaningful work cannot be stripped from you. In our world, happiness occurs more frequently. When a preschool teacher sees a struggling student improve, that daily joy outweighs the banker\u2019s once-every-two-years bonus that\u2019s preceded by anxiety and burnout. High-paying jobs also push you into morally gray areas. The banker foreclosing on a family\u2019s home or the lawyer separating a parent from their children experiences moral discomfort that corrodes long-term well-being.",

The banker foreclosing on a family\u2019s home or the lawyer separating a parent from their children experiences moral discomfort that corrodes long-term well-being. Even if passions change, by your twenties they are largely stable. And if they do evolve, you can pivot \u2014 something much harder to do if you\u2019ve built your entire life around a paycheck you can\u2019t afford to lose. ** Arg 2: Why Money Cannot Buy Happiness**\nThe idea that success is defined by income is manufactured by the elite. It\u2019s a system designed to preserve hierarchy \u2014 one that tells us some jobs are \u201cvaluable\u201d and others are disposable, even when the people doing them keep society running. We reject that premise entirely. First, consumerism gives only short-term pleasure. The dopamine rush from buying a house or going on vacation fades quickly. This is the hedonic treadmill: once you adapt to luxuries, you crave more just to feel the same satisfaction. Second, in a consumerist society, you are constantly told that what you have isn\u2019t enough. Advertising and culture push the belief that happiness equals more \u2014 more wealth, more prestige, more possessions. That\u2019s a formula for perpetual dissatisfaction. Third, high-paying jobs come with immense pressure to perform and maintain status.",

You fear underperforming, losing clients, or slipping behind peers. You\u2019re constantly anxious about investments, promotions, and reputation. The result is chronic insecurity and burnout. Money, therefore, traps you in an endless loop of pursuit and comparison. You run faster on a treadmill that never stops, and you never actually arrive. **Arg 3: Why We Build Better Relationships**\nRelationships define the quality of life. But in their world, relationships are weakened and transactional. People working long hours have little time for family. They miss dinners, milestones, and meaningful conversations. Even at home, they\u2019re mentally still at work \u2014 checking emails, taking calls, chasing deadlines. They become spectators in their children\u2019s lives, hiring nannies or caretakers to fill in. In our world, people have time to build and maintain bonds. They eat together, talk through problems, and create shared memories. When conflicts happen \u2014 as they inevitably do \u2014 there\u2019s time and emotional space to fix them. Being present is half the work of love, and that\u2019s something inaccessible in their world. Friendships suffer, too. Your workplace defines your social circle.",

In high-stakes fields, those circles are hyper-competitive \u2014 everyone\u2019s goal is advancement, not connection. You\u2019re surrounded by people driven by status and material success, which makes genuine friendship rare. In contrast, our world attracts people with shared values. Passionate people build communities grounded in purpose and empathy rather than comparison. Those friendships are deeper, more stable, and more meaningful. **Conclusion**\nIn their world, you trade meaning for money and end up chasing fulfillment you never find. You work harder, feel emptier, and lose touch with who you are and the people you love. In our world, you build a life grounded in purpose, relationships, and memories that last. You live with integrity, connection, and joy \u2014 not just comfort. That is why we are proud to choose the job we are passionate about.",
