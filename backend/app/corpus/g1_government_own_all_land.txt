Governments have tinkered on the edges of property. They thought to regulate it, but regulatory bodies were captured by the landed gentry. They tried zoning and eminent domain laws, but the former gave owners huge discretion while the latter saw governments fork out above market rate prices for land. It is time we regain control through limited term contracts. Land is a crucial economic asset allowing people to earn an income through agricultural production or provision of government services like public housing and hospitals. Hence, the metric for this debate should be how we best utilize this scarce resource. In the status quo, there is an unjust distribution of land where, due to historical factors like the monarchy in Britain, slavery in America, and apartheid in South Africa, land is held by the wealthy elite. In America and South Africa, black individuals still own a vanishing minority of land, while in Britain, three families with links to the monarchy own over a third of the land in central London. We prefer a world where all land is held by the government at least on limited term contracts. This is not a policy debate; thus, this is not about the process of seizing land but rather two counterfactuals. In our model, the government already owns and leases all land, but in opposition, they must defend the status quo of largely private ownership and cannot propose a counter model. To be clear, we acknowledge value in privately held land, but perpetually held land is problematic. Governments will set an expiration date for land at the end of one generation, which can range from 50 to 90 years. At the end of that period, the land will be returned to the government. The government can decide to lease back the land to the previous owner, put the lease onto the open market, or repurpose it for public use. This decision will be made through consulting city planners and citizenry. Governments already control essential assets such as Norway's government controlling natural gas, the United States over mineral rights, and national parks. My case will prove how we can better develop land. First, we solve the government need for land. Second, we improve private land use. Third, my second speaker will show how perpetual land ownership on opposition fuels speculation that raises otherwise productive land. Our first argument is that we solve the government need for land. Governments have a frequent need for land for public services, to reserve state land, or to sell to generate much-needed revenue. This comes at a time where the need for land is mounting due to climate change and booming populations in the developing world. When land is held in perpetuity by private owners, governments have insufficient land. In the early phases of development, governments sold out large swathes of prime real estate for steep discounts to corporations and the wealthy, meaning governments now are unlikely to hold on to sufficient land in their reserves. If they try to acquire land from the open market, they are forced to bid higher prices to snap up the land. They face the same problem if they try to use eminent domain laws because this contravention of private property rights often requires governments to pay above market rates for land. The idea of governments just seizing land from the rich without paying for it will be met with strong opposition from the very lobby groups that funded the campaigns of the incumbent government. Hence, it's unlikely to be an alternative that governments will ever support in opposition. This leaves opposition with two

realistic options: one, the government foregoes critical public services like affordable housing, schools, and hospitals as they cannot be built without land. We have seen this in Hong Kong, where a major housing crisis means the average home costs a family 21 times the annual income. This is because developers effectively control housing supply when the government holds insufficient land. The second alternative the opposition is left with is the government seizes land, but instead of from the rich, they do it from those who offer them the least resistance: nature reserves, indigenous groups, and squatters with no documentation are forced out of their homes. This is what happened in Brazil, where part of the push to commercialize more land saw parts of the Amazon rainforest cleared and slums in Rio forcefully torn down, leaving thousands of families homeless. Our solution is for the government to lease up the land in a staggered manner, affording greater control through two key mechanisms: one, there is a regular supply of land for critical users such as building new schools, hospitals, or to sell for revenue. Two, we ensure a consistent supply of land that allows governments to do proper land use planning, as they can alter land use to suit changing needs, such as allocating more land to public housing when there is a lack of it.
