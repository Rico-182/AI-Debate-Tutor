Language generating AI can be productive and good, but when it entrenches itself in the creative industry, it becomes harmful. We don't think language generating AI should be used in creative contexts. While basic functions like technical work are acceptable, the problem arises when it influences what we read and believe. These AIs are error-prone and make mistakes in context and conclusions. They learn from data that is often biased, predominantly written by white males, leading to majoritarian perspectives. Quality checks may be in place, but they are implemented by the same individuals who introduce biases. Human writers, despite their flaws, provide diverse perspectives that can counteract biases. The reliance on AI in creative industries risks homogenizing ideas and narratives, stifling critical thought. Additionally, the introduction of AI can lead to job losses in creative sectors, as companies may prefer the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of AI over human labor. This consolidation of power in a few corporations can lead to monopolies, reducing competition and innovation. We argue that the risks of language generating AI in creative industries outweigh the benefits.
