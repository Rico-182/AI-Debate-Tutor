[METADATA] Motion: This House would use sanctions to settle rogue states | Side: Opposition
1. Sanctions Are Structurally Too Weak
Sanctions always erode. Target states learn to reroute trade, diversify currency reserves, and build alternative financial channels. That means the initial economic hit collapses fast. Meanwhile, sanctioning coalitions splinter—each government has incentives to grant exemptions to protect its own industries. Once the regime sees these cracks, they know they can wait it out.
Mechanism: The target updates its expectations. If compliance is costly, but endurance is feasible, they rationally choose endurance.
2. Sanctioned Leaders Won’t Capitulate
Even if sanctions bite, leaders still refuse to fold because giving in once creates a precedent for future coercion. Anti-Western and nationalist elites interpret compliance as humiliation. Their political survival depends on projecting defiance, not flexibility.
Mechanism: Leaders weigh regime security > economic welfare. Conceding to sanctions signals weakness, increasing internal threats.
3. Sanctions Hurt Civilians More Than Regimes
Sanctions hit income, jobs, and essential goods long before elites feel anything. Populations become poorer, services collapse, and humanitarian groups struggle to deliver aid under complex compliance rules. Governments then weaponize the suffering—framing it as “foreign sabotage”—which delegitimizes pro-democracy activists and discourages protest.
Mechanism: The costs concentrate on politically weak groups, while elites can shield themselves through patronage and smuggling networks.
4. Sanctions Entench Worse Governance Long-Term
As the economy contracts, states become more statist and repressive to maintain control. Black markets expand, security forces tighten, and moderates purged. The middle class—the group most associated with democratization—shrinks.
Mechanism: Restriction → scarcity → political centralization → entrenchment of hardliners.
Examples (headlines-level)
Cuba: decades of sanctions with zero regime change.
North Korea: sanctions coexisted with nuclear acceleration.
Haiti: embargo worsened economic collapse without fixing governance.
[METADATA] Motion: This House would use sanctions to settle rogue states | Side: Opposition
Weighing: Even if sanctions sometimes apply pressure, they systematically produce high civilian suffering, long-term authoritarian resilience, and unreliable compliance. The alternative tools—diplomacy, conditional aid, and targeted political engagement—avoid harming civilians and avoid entrenching the worst parts of the regime.
