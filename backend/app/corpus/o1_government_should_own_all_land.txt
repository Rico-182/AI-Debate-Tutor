In Singapore, 31,000 government flats lie unoccupied. In China, entire ghost towns pollute the countryside, taking away land that could have been used for industry or agriculture. Singapore only owns 80% of government land. If they were to own 100% of government land, their government's incentives would have been far worse because absolute power corrupts absolutely. Let's be very sharp about the burdens in this debate. Singapore has to defend 100% of government land usage. Our stance is that in the status quo, governments already own a fair amount of land, but the majority of land is privately owned. This is important because it places two burdens on team Singapore. First, they need to show why the government needs 100% of the land in order to achieve any of their benefits. Intuitively, not 100% of land is residential; not 100% of land needs to be built for hospitals, so we can probably get that benefit on our side because the government already owns fair amounts of land. Second, they need to show that the benefits of owning 100% of land are worth trading off the massive economic and social benefits of private property. What sort of property is state-owned in the status quo? It's probably specific natural resources like some mines or national parks, areas in metropolitan or rural areas to provide public services or hospitals, and some agricultural land. The minority of land is privately owned, and we support this. I'm going forward with two arguments in this speech, but first, I'd like to respond to the case of team Singapore. The first thing I'd like to respond to is their policy. They don't have the fiat to have a policy. This house prefers; they have the fiat to say that the government will own this land. They don't have the fiat to say how it will be implemented, so they needed to logically justify, and they did not at all, why it would be once in a generation given the context of lobbying. There are two reasons why it won't be. First, it's likely to be short-term leases like five to 25 years because governments operate on short-term election cycles. They want to be able to change who owns the land in order to meet electoral demands and serve their people. Second, the shorter the leases are, the more leverage the government has over companies. If the companies want to do things like be kicked out or if the government wants to do things like kick the companies out or force them to meet demand to renew the lease. Let's talk about their argument. It's funny that they use Hong Kong as an example in a prep motion when a simple Google search would reveal that this is an area where 100% of people own the land. They say four developers monopolize the land. Yes, because the state only grants leases to those four developers. The third structural reason was lobbying groups, which is symmetric. They don't have the fiat to get rid of lobbying, so Hong Kong is exactly what they have to bear, where elite people can capture the government and then the government allocates land in that way. Eminent domain isn't as bad as they say it is. The reason why it works is that the fair market value of land is what is used to calculate eminent domain and how much the government has to pay. Fair market value is also used to calculate the property income tax burden that someone has to pay. When you self-report your property, you have an incentive to

report that on the lower end of the spectrum because you don't want to pay high property taxes. Governments can probably reasonably acquire private land if they really want to. We finally come to the point of hoarding. If you can't use that land productively, you're losing massive amounts of potential revenue, so you're likely to hire somebody else to come in and do that. You don't have to do it yourself; you can hire a company to do that for you or just sell the land to somebody who can. My first argument in this speech is that giving government ownership over all land creates perverse incentives to misallocate. We agree that governments have good incentives in the status quo, but when land ownership becomes a privilege, not a right, the government becomes far less accountable and allocates land far worse for three layers. First, access to land depends on the goodwill of the government in proposition. The government has absolute discretion to allocate land. They concede this for two reasons: first, leases expire automatically, so there's one chance, and the government has the automatic ability to revert back to that land ownership. Second, you need to apply for government permission to renew a lease. This means that the government automatically gets the land and has the ability to control it. In the status quo, because of property rights, if the government wants to take land, it has to justify why this is genuinely in the public interest. The reason why this is important is that private owners have an incentive to challenge in things like the courts and in the court of public opinion, so the government is forced to justify why it has a public interest in being able to take that land. It only takes it when it really needs it. Moreover, it's harder to scrutinize when the state owns 100% of the millions of kilometers of land, as opposed to the limited government land ownership that it has right now. This means that the government on proposition doesn't have to justify how they allocate land because it's just the norm. There is far less accountability about how they allocate land on their side of the house. If your claim is that governments will give in to short-term election demands, then why would they pay below market rates on fair market prices for eminent domain when the electorate will expect them to pay high prices to rich people so that their public housing is more expensive? It doesn't make sense. The vast majority of the electorate would want the government to pay high prices to rich people so that their public housing is more expensive. Second layer: the ability of the public to compare privately owned land to publicly owned land in the status quo. Since most land is privately held, if the government wants to maintain its use of its land, it has to use that land productively because people can viscerally compare that to the way in which the private sector is productively using land. If the land is poorly managed, you have nothing to compare it to because you don't know a more efficient system where it existed. This means that there are far fewer protests on their side of the house, far fewer people willing to speak out against the government, and far less accountability. This is devastating for their case. Governments have the ability to crush dissent on their side of the house because land is the basis of the majority of economic and social activity within the state. You need

it for shelter, for the ability to have industry, and for the ability to run a media company. Granting the government the ability to own all land and making it a privilege to grant means the government has the ability to crush down and take away the land and the economic rights of anyone within the state who speaks out. In the Philippines, the government had the discretion to grant media licenses, so it took it away from ABS-CBN, which is a news company, to crush dissent. This chilling effect applies to every newspaper and every protester because if you speak out against the government, it will take away your lease or it will not be renewed. The company will be forced to go under or forced to go to a sub-optimal location. Governments want to do this because most governments tend to have a dominant party in power at some point, and they have the incentive to maintain power and crush dissent. On our side, people are more sensitive to property; they can speak out against the government. The impact on the comparative is that the government is less accountable on their side of the house since people don't know or are too afraid to call the government out, which means more corruption of that land and more government sending that land to cronies or elites who can afford to be corrupt because nobody will call them out. This means more governments allocating land towards firms that lobbied for their re-election campaigns and less public housing that they would want. This is the metric that team Singapore took on themselves. They wanted to prove that the land allocation would be better on their side of the house. We say it is far worse, and we can claim all their benefits because the limited amount of land that the government owns now is sufficient.
