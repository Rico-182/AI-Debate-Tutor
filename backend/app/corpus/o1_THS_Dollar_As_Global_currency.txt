[METADATA] Motion: This House believes that the global reliance on the US dollar is detrimental to the global economy. OR This House would support the diversification of international currencies away from the US dollar. | Side: Opposition

The current economic crisis is happening because the dollar has strengthened due to a host of external factors, such as COVID and the Ukraine war. We prefer that the dollar is used by all countries around the world. The dollar is inherently less volatile than any other currency when pegged against. The US has the biggest economy in the world, diversified into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors, which means it is by far the most stable currency. The US democratic system has checks and balances that ensure the dollar has a floating value that is stable and predictable. The political institutions and autonomy of the central bank in the US are stronger than anywhere else. Even if there are failures, the political system allows for accountability and mitigation of crises. Predictability is important because currency value is often based on hedging and speculation. Small countries are unlikely to be rational actors and may trade off long-term economic risk for short-term gains. The dollar is a better option than currencies like the Yuan or Ruble, which are subject to government control and instability. Fracturing currencies leads to difficulties in trade and increases risk. The US dollar allows for free trade and minimizes costs, which improves efficiency among economies. The dollar is also an important foreign policy tool that allows the US to sanction countries, which is necessary for global accountability. The US has internal accountability and a diverse population that cares about global issues, unlike authoritarian regimes. The dollar is less risky than alternatives, and we should oppose any motion that seeks to undermine its status.
