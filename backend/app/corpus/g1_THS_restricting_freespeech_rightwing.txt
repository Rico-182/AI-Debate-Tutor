[METADATA] Motion: This House supports restrictions on free speech to combat the rise of right-wing populism OR This House believes that limiting free speech is necessary to protect minorities from populist rhetoric | Side: Government

Right-wing populist parties, individuals, and activists worldwide are a threat to minorities and to democracy. Government solves this problem. Courts should decide if these are right-wing populists using five criteria: nativism, hostility towards elites, accessibility to authoritarianism, political correctness, and a shallow policy agenda. We would institute a range of restrictions on free speech of political parties and practices that goes from shutting down websites and individuals advocating on their behalf to banning them from social media or contesting elections entirely. This is an extension of the precedent set in the banning of the neo-Nazi party in Germany. We would support this policy if a similar problem arose with left-wing populism. We have two burdens in this debate: to show that this policy is justified and that it is effective in dealing with the danger that right-wing populists present. Our first argument is that we combat the threat to minorities. Right-wing populism thrives on riling people up and channeling their anger, often blaming minority groups for their issues. This leads to increased violence against these groups. Our policy solves this by reducing the ability of right-wing populists to spread their hatred. Our second argument is that this harms the development of solutions to the problems that lead to right-wing populists coming about. Right-wing populism drags politics to the right-wing populist cutter, forcing centrist parties to adopt similar rhetoric. This distorts political discourse and harms the development of nuanced solutions. We believe that protecting the most vulnerable from physical harm outweighs the ability of certain individuals to have freedom of speech.
