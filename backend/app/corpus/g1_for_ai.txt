As a CS student, I'm excited about the intersectionality between my education and these debates. I'm going to frame what these language processing AIs are and present two substantive claims. First, this technology is generally beneficial. Second, it will be done in a good way. We're talking about a specific subset of artificial intelligence that generates text based on user input. A good example is GitHub Copilot, which generates lines of code based on the user's request. This technology eases menial tasks for creative coders, allowing them to focus on the conceptual aspects of coding. The essential function is to save time in writing. The first benefit is that this technology increases productivity, making tasks less costly and more efficient. For example, a news author can input major points and have an article generated, saving hours of work. The second benefit is its unique advantage for individuals with difficulties in writing, such as those with ADHD or dyslexia. This technology removes barriers for creative individuals who struggle with traditional writing tasks, enhancing accessibility. Lastly, it can lead to new developments in languages and linguistics, similar to how AI in chess has led to new strategic insights. These benefits are exclusive to our side of the house. I will now address potential opposition arguments. They may claim that this technology could lead to racism or unemployment. However, there will be quality checks on generated content, and it is easier to correct biases in AI than in human writers. This technology does not replace jobs but makes certain tasks easier, allowing humans to focus on more complex aspects of their work. Therefore, we support the benefits of language generating AI.
