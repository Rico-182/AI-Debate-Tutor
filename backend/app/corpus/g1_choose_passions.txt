** Role: Prime Minister
** Side: Proposition/government
** Format: WSDC
** Motion: You are a talented, middle-class person in your early twenties about to start your career. You have the choice between a job in which you will make a lot of money and work long hours (e.g., investment banker, corporate lawyer, etc.) and a job which pays less but that you are more passionate about (e.g.: social worker, chef, teacher, small business owner, etc).
This house would choose the job they are passionate about


Speech: 

The most heinous crime in human existence was never a single war or any single act of violence. It isn’t even one event. The worst crime happens every single day — when the boy who dreamed of becoming a teacher grudgingly chooses to go to medical school, when a lawyer sits back in her office and wonders what would have happened if she had chosen to cook, when we look at who we are and who we became, the people we left behind, and remember the day we killed our own dreams because society told us to. That is the world we oppose.
Inside government, I have three points of framing before I move into my arguments.
First, in both worlds there’s a guarantee of success. We’re talking about a talented, middle-class individual who is capable of succeeding in any field — whether doctor, lawyer, or teacher. In both worlds, you’ll still likely be able to pay bills, send kids to school, and put food on the table. In our world, you might not have every luxury, but you’ll maintain stability and middle-class comfort.
Second, we’re talking about individuals aged twenty to thirty — the defining decade of life. It’s the period that sets your trajectory, one you can’t rewind. This debate is therefore binary: once you choose a path, you likely stay in it.
Third, what does each world look like? On their side, you earn more but work long hours in competitive, high-pressure fields like law or finance. You exert enormous effort but may not feel fulfillment. You make money, yes, but the work feels empty. On our side, you earn less, but you do something you love — something you once dreamed about, something that gives your life meaning.
The burden in this debate is simple: which side creates a happier, more fulfilled life — both now and in the long term.
I’ll advance three arguments:
Why passion makes people happy.
Why money fails to create lasting happiness.
Why we build better relationships.
**Arg 1: Why Passion Makes People Happy**
The value of life is measured by experience. Everyone agrees that life is limited, so if you spend most of it doing something you dislike — trapped in an office, drained by meaningless work — that’s a subpar existence.
In our world, you get fulfillment from your job because you’re doing what you truly want. That happiness is not conditional on success or failure. Whether you’re teaching a kid or acting on stage, you’re happy simply because you’re doing what you love.
That joy also materializes as memories. The happiness that comes from money fluctuates — bad investments, inflation, or theft can take it away. But memories of meaningful work cannot be stripped from you.
In our world, happiness occurs more frequently. When a preschool teacher sees a struggling student improve, that daily joy outweighs the banker’s once-every-two-years bonus that’s preceded by anxiety and burnout.
High-paying jobs also push you into morally gray areas. The banker foreclosing on a family’s home or the lawyer separating a parent from their children experiences moral discomfort that corrodes long-term well-being.
Even if passions change, by your twenties they are largely stable. And if they do evolve, you can pivot — something much harder to do if you’ve built your entire life around a paycheck you can’t afford to lose.
** Arg 2: Why Money Cannot Buy Happiness**
The idea that success is defined by income is manufactured by the elite. It’s a system designed to preserve hierarchy — one that tells us some jobs are “valuable” and others are disposable, even when the people doing them keep society running. We reject that premise entirely.
First, consumerism gives only short-term pleasure. The dopamine rush from buying a house or going on vacation fades quickly. This is the hedonic treadmill: once you adapt to luxuries, you crave more just to feel the same satisfaction.
Second, in a consumerist society, you are constantly told that what you have isn’t enough. Advertising and culture push the belief that happiness equals more — more wealth, more prestige, more possessions. That’s a formula for perpetual dissatisfaction.
Third, high-paying jobs come with immense pressure to perform and maintain status. You fear underperforming, losing clients, or slipping behind peers. You’re constantly anxious about investments, promotions, and reputation. The result is chronic insecurity and burnout.
Money, therefore, traps you in an endless loop of pursuit and comparison. You run faster on a treadmill that never stops, and you never actually arrive.
**Arg 3: Why We Build Better Relationships**
Relationships define the quality of life. But in their world, relationships are weakened and transactional.
People working long hours have little time for family. They miss dinners, milestones, and meaningful conversations. Even at home, they’re mentally still at work — checking emails, taking calls, chasing deadlines. They become spectators in their children’s lives, hiring nannies or caretakers to fill in.
In our world, people have time to build and maintain bonds. They eat together, talk through problems, and create shared memories. When conflicts happen — as they inevitably do — there’s time and emotional space to fix them. Being present is half the work of love, and that’s something inaccessible in their world.
Friendships suffer, too. Your workplace defines your social circle. In high-stakes fields, those circles are hyper-competitive — everyone’s goal is advancement, not connection. You’re surrounded by people driven by status and material success, which makes genuine friendship rare.
In contrast, our world attracts people with shared values. Passionate people build communities grounded in purpose and empathy rather than comparison. Those friendships are deeper, more stable, and more meaningful.

**Conclusion**
In their world, you trade meaning for money and end up chasing fulfillment you never find. You work harder, feel emptier, and lose touch with who you are and the people you love.
In our world, you build a life grounded in purpose, relationships, and memories that last. You live with integrity, connection, and joy — not just comfort.
That is why we are proud to choose the job we are passionate about.
