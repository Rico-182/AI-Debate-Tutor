This House believes that the world’s poor would be justified in pursuing a Marxist revolution.

Madame Chair, across the globe, the poor live under what is effectively a dictatorship. Not always a dictatorship of a single man in a uniform, but the dictatorship of “no alternatives.” They are shackled by capital that was never fairly earned, constrained by landed elites and corporate interests that have every incentive to protect themselves, and chained to the daily question of subsistence rather than any meaningful chance at liberty or self-determination. They do not lack work ethic. They lack power.

Let me start by explaining what we mean by a “Marxist revolution” in this debate. At its core, a Marxist revolution is any political or social process that aims to dismantle the institution of private property in the means of production. That can look like one of two things.

First, it can happen internally, through existing institutions: workers and the poor can vote in governments that support massive redistribution of wealth, nationalization of key industries, and the abolition of private ownership over the things that produce value. Second, it can happen externally, when people forcibly overthrow governments and economic orders that have, for generations, trampled their rights and used state power to defend property rather than people.

We are not naïve. We accept that not every attempted revolution succeeds. In many places this won’t look like storming the presidential palace; it will look like Marxist parties gaining power, forcing concessions, or structurally remaking the economy piece by piece. But in the world where these revolutions do succeed, we invite you to use your imagination and to question your own historical bias. The system of private property you take for granted is not timeless or natural. It is a relatively recent invention, crystallizing around the Enlightenment and the last few centuries of capitalist development. For most of human history, people lived in far more communal arrangements, where identity was not exhausted by their labor market value and where sharing, reciprocity, and community obligations mattered more than individual asset accumulation. That is the direction we want to move back toward.

I’m going to make two big claims in this speech.

First, private property as it exists today is a fundamental assault on human dignity, and the poor have a moral right to overthrow it.

Second, the idea that the poor can achieve justice through gradual reform inside the current global system is a fantasy; the structure is set up to block meaningful change, which means revolution is not just understandable, but justified.

Let’s start with dignity.

Private property is not some neutral baseline. In most of the world, large fortunes are built on centuries of plunder: slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and the violent appropriation of land and resources. The wealth of many “developed” nations is nothing more than the stored value of labor and land taken at gunpoint from people who never consented. Even when the theft is less direct, it persists through negligence and rigging of the rules: restrictive intellectual property regimes that deny the poor access to lifesaving medicines and technologies; tax systems designed to protect capital flight and avoid any serious redistribution.

If I steal from you and then lock in a legal system that protects my stolen goods, the fact that it is “legal” doesn’t make it just. The poor have a moral claim not only to the resources taken from them, but to the transformation of the institutions that enabled that theft. Revolution is the vehicle for that redress.

And even if you grant the opposition their best-case scenario — even if we “wipe the slate clean” and pretend that everyone somehow started from equal access to resources — private property still systematically degrades dignity.

Competition in capitalist markets is built on arbitrary advantages. Some people are born in rich countries, some in poor ones. Some inherit networks, education, and capital; others inherit nothing. Some are born with skills or traits that markets happen to reward; others are born with different talents that markets ignore. None of these differences are morally earned. They are accidents of birth. Yet our system converts these accidents into life-and-death differences in income, security, and respect. That is not a neutral outcome. It is a system that says your worth as a human being is determined by where you were born, what your parents owned, and what traits the market finds profitable.

Worse, capital gets to decide what reproduces capital. Owners decide who is hired, what kinds of work are valued, which communities get investment, which regions are left to rot. The people who are already powerful get to determine the rules of the game that keep them powerful. That is a direct attack on the dignity of those who are constantly told that their only role is to sell their labor cheaply and be grateful for the chance.

So on principle: the poor are justified in rejecting that system, not just tweaking it at the margins.

Now to the second claim: can we fix this from the inside? The opposition’s entire story depends on the idea that we don’t need revolution because we can use democracy, institutions, and international cooperation to gradually reform capitalism. That sounds nice; it just doesn’t describe the real world.

Domestically, in many countries, electoral systems are structurally skewed. Gerrymandering, malapportionment, and district design mean that the poor are often concentrated in “wasted” constituencies where their votes change very little. They do not control mainstream media, which shapes what counts as “serious” economic policy and constantly paints radical redistribution as dangerous or irresponsible. Racial and ethnic divides are weaponized to ensure that poor communities turn against each other instead of uniting against the wealthy. And because of generations of disenfranchisement, the poor are less likely to vote in the first place: if your experience of politics is that nothing ever changes for you, why would you participate?

Internationally, the picture is even worse. The institutions that govern the global economy — the IMF, World Bank, trade regimes, credit rating agencies — were designed by wealthy states to lock in their advantage. The human rights framework that gets enforced in practice focuses heavily on civil and political rights, but treats socio-economic rights as aspirational talking points, not obligations. You can’t sue the IMF for forcing austerity on your country. You can’t drag a multinational corporation to The Hague for exploiting your labor. The system is structurally biased in favor of capital-owning states and firms. The idea that this system will voluntarily produce the deep redistribution the poor need is a fantasy.

That’s the real choice in this debate: not “revolution versus a well-functioning social democracy,” but “revolution versus a structurally rigged status quo that occasionally throws you a bone.”

At this point, opposition often points to recent progress: they’ll say that in the last few decades, hundreds of millions of people, especially in Asia, have been lifted out of income-defined poverty under capitalism, because companies had an incentive to unlock cheap labor. That sounds compelling until you look at where those gains actually came from.

Take China: the largest anti-poverty program in human history. That did not happen because private corporations woke up one day and decided to be nice. It happened because a nominally communist state used massive public investment, land reforms, state-directed industrial policy, and redistribution to develop its economy. If the opposition wants to claim China as a capitalist success story, they’re basically pointing to a heavily state-directed, Marxist-inspired project and saying, “See, private property works!” That’s incoherent.

When revolutions or revolutionary movements succeed, the poor have genuine leverage. They are the global majority. Capital cannot generate profit without labor. When workers withdraw their consent or seize control of production, they hold real bargaining power. Many of the world’s key natural resources are located in poorer countries; revolution puts control of those resources in the hands of the people who live there, rather than foreign shareholders.

Crucially, a Marxist lens encourages cross-border solidarity. Right now, capital has every incentive to divide workers by race, nationality, and religion, to keep wages low and unions weak. A revolutionary movement that explicitly frames the struggle as poor against rich, exploited against exploiter, rather than nation against nation, creates space for global solidarity that undercuts the “race to the bottom” dynamic.

Even in the so-called “failed” cases, revolutionary pressure often generates meaningful reforms along the way: land redistribution, expanded welfare states, stronger labor rights, constitutional protections for socio-economic rights. None of those came because elites simply woke up and decided to be generous. They came because they were forced to concede.

So what must the opposition do to win? It’s not enough for them to point to marginal welfare programs or charitable initiatives. They must provide a serious moral defense of private property itself: explain why fortunes built on slavery, colonialism, and resource theft are somehow legitimate; explain why a system that converts arbitrary birth conditions into life chances is not an assault on dignity; explain how, in the real world of gerrymandered democracies and captured international institutions, the poor are going to achieve deep structural justice without ever fundamentally threatening the economic order.

They will not be able to do that.

Given the historical theft, the ongoing structural violence of the current system, and the systematic barriers to reform, the world’s poor are not just understandably angry. They are justified in pursuing a Marxist revolution.
