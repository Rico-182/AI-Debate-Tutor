[METADATA] Motion: This House supports restrictions on free speech to combat the rise of right-wing populism OR This House believes that limiting free speech is necessary to protect minorities from populist rhetoric | Side: Opposition

Right-wing populism is an ideology that can be distilled into five key characteristics. It is demeaning to reduce the legitimate viewpoints of millions of people to a scientific dissection. We will not impose any restrictions on right-wing populist speech. We believe in the value of free speech, even if it is racially tinged. The proposition's burden is not just to defend current laws restricting free speech but to define restricting the entirety of this political ideology. Our first argument is that right-wing populist speech is legitimate and should not be restricted. Democracy without choice is not a democracy. Right-wing populism embraces viewpoints that are defensible, like the government having a foremost duty to its citizens. Our second argument is that the proposition's policy risks government abuse. The vagueness of their criteria allows for selective prosecution. We argue that the chilling effect on discourse harms the very individuals they claim to protect. We believe that silence is oppression and that we should allow for representation of all viewpoints, even those that are unpopular.
