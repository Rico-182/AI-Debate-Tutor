[METADATA] Motion: This House prefers a world in which success and failure are seen as a consequence of random factors rather than personal actions. OR This House believes that success should not be attributed solely to individual effort. | Side: Opposition

Chair, adjudicators, ladies and gentlemen, the proposition's narrative mutes your achievements and locks those who fail in a prison of comfort. They tell you that working harder wouldn't have made a difference; you were simply born to fail. We acknowledge the factors that make success difficult but strive for relative success. On our side, people feel in control of their destiny. They can see their lot in life and take steps to improve it. Success is relative; if you were poor and become middle class, that is success. We agree with the proposition but believe success does not have to be absolute. The first claim is that success is arbitrary due to the birth lottery and randomness. We argue that success is not as arbitrary as they claim. If I study more or practice more, I will tend to do better. Even if success was arbitrary, it is not totalizing; people take backgrounds into account. We live in a socially aware society where discussions about privilege occur. The pursuit of success makes people feel good, and if success is seen as random, it diminishes the joy of winning. On our side, winning feels rewarding because it results from hard work. Losing hurts less because you maintain pride in your performance. On their side, when you lose, you attribute it to random factors, leading to a lack of motivation. People become dejected and feel hopeless. They believe their destiny is not in their control. On our side, individuals believe they can improve their lives. The second argument is about minorities. On our side, people are told they can overcome barriers. The proposition's narrative suggests that success is predetermined, which is harmful. We believe in agency and control over one's life. Social movements have broken down barriers because people recognized their ability to change their circumstances. Our narrative motivates individuals to strive for success. On their side, people are resigned to their fate. The third argument is about social mobility. We argue that it is easier on our side because people believe they can change their circumstances. The proposition's narrative creates a sense of hopelessness. We believe in the power of practice and agency. In conclusion, people work harder on our side, and we create a better environment for minorities to thrive.
