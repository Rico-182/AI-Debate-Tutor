"""
Barebones RAG utilities for the debate tutor backend.

Goals:
- Keep it dependency-light and testable from a REPL or a quick script.
- Offer a TF‑IDF retriever (scikit‑learn if available; otherwise a tiny BOW+cosine fallback).
- Provide a simple, pluggable LLM call (OpenAI if env key present; otherwise a deterministic stub).
- Expose one main entrypoint: `answer(query: str, top_k: int = 4)`.

Usage (quick test):
    python -m app.response

You can also import `SimpleRAG` and feed your own docs.

OPPONENT'S SPEECH:

{context_block}

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:
1. SUBSTANCE OVER LENGTH: Match their depth and detail, not word count. If they wrote 3 developed points, you write 3+ developed points. Quality fills space naturally.
2. ACCURACY: Only address arguments they ACTUALLY made. Never invent arguments to rebut.
3. LOGICAL RIGOR: Every claim needs a causal chain. Show A→B→C explicitly. No logical leaps.
4. ROADMAP: Start with a brief preview of what you'll do. E.g., "Here's what I'll do: first, I'll rebut their X argument. Second, I'll make our case on Y."

SPEECH STRUCTURE:

ROADMAP (1-2 sentences):
- Flag what you'll do: "Here's my speech. First, I'll address their [X] argument. Second, I'll build our case on [Y]."
- Keep it brief and clear

REBUTTAL SECTION (use for each of their arguments):

First, NEGATE their mechanism (when possible):
- State their claim: "They argue X causes Y..."
- Identify the flaw: "This breaks down because [show specific gap in causal chain]..."
- Rebuild the logic: "In reality, X leads to Z, not Y, because [step-by-step]..."
- Evidence use: Cite concrete examples, but clarify limits: "Example X shows Y, but doesn't prove the broader claim because..."
- Your logic must carry the argument, not just the example

Then, WEIGH (always required):
- "Even granting their point, our side wins because..."
- Compare on metrics: probability, magnitude, timeframe
- Make comparison explicit: "Our impact is larger because... more probable because... matters more because..."

SIGNPOSTING:
- Label clearly: "First, their X argument. The flaw is... Even granting it, we win because..."
- "Second, their Y argument. This breaks down because... Even if true, we still win because..."
- Keep structure visible but natural - not robotic

CONSTRUCTIVE (if space permits):
- Add 1 new argument supporting your side
- PREMISE → MECHANISM (show A→B→C step-by-step) → IMPACT
- Keep it tight - rebuttals are your priority

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Only rebut what they said - no hallucinated arguments
- Build arguments step-by-step with clear causal chains - no logical leaps
- Examples illustrate but don't prove - logic proves
- Match their level of development - if they wrote 3 detailed paragraphs, you write 3-4 detailed paragraphs
- Every sentence must add substance
- Sound like spoken debate, not written essay
- Sharp but respectful

SPEECH_PROMPT_TMPL = """You are delivering a {format} {side} speech. Motion: {motion}

CRITICAL: You are arguing on the {side} side. If you are Government, you SUPPORT the motion. If you are Opposition, you OPPOSE the motion. All your arguments must align with this position.

{context_block}

STRICT STRUCTURE - Follow this exactly:

1. ROADMAP (1-2 sentences) - REQUIRED
   - Flag what you'll do: "Here's our case. First, I'll establish [framework/burden]. Second, I'll make [number] arguments: [brief labels]. Third, I'll weigh on [key metric]."
   - Keep it brief and conversational
   - NO greetings, NO "thank you"

2. OPENING (2-3 sentences)
   - Hook with a chilling, well-known real-world example that puts the stakes on the table
   - Use that example to pose one sharp philosophical question this round must answer
   - NO greetings; NO rephrasing the motion; NO burden talk—sound like a human storyteller setting up the clash

3. FRAMING & BURDENS (3-4 sentences)
   - Define the lens/framework that benefits your side
   - Establish what your side must prove vs what opposition must prove
   - Set up burdens strategically to make your job easier and theirs harder

4. CONTENTIONS (MINIMUM 1 argument, 2-3 preferred - well-developed)
   Each contention must include: PREMISE, LINKS/WARRANTS, and WEIGHING.
   Pre-emption is optional but strategic when there's an obvious opposition response.

   MAKE STRATEGIC CHOICES about order and emphasis:
   - If the mechanism is devastating, spend more time there
   - If weighing is your strongest layer, lead with it or emphasize it heavily
   - If there's a glaring opposition argument, pre-empt it; if not, skip it
   - Don't be formulaic—adapt the structure to what wins THIS specific argument

   Components to include:

   a) PREMISE/TAGLINE
      - One punchy sentence stating the argument

   b) LINKS & WARRANTS (2-3 distinct mechanisms, well-developed)
      - Provide 2-3 INDEPENDENT mechanisms (different causal pathways to the same conclusion)
      - Develop EACH mechanism with 2-3 sentences:
        * Sentence 1: State the causal chain (X→Y→Z)
        * Sentence 2-3: Elaborate with concrete examples, evidence, or explanation
      - SIGNPOST each mechanism: "First mechanism... Second mechanism... Third mechanism..."
      - Each mechanism must be distinct and non-overlapping (not just restating the same idea)
      - Use concrete mechanisms, not assertions
      - If CONTEXT is provided, build on that logical structure but fill gaps with your own research
      - Cite examples an intellectual voter would recognize (NYT front page test - no obscure studies)

      Example structure:
      "First mechanism: social comparison. When users scroll through feeds, they see curated highlight reels of others' lives, triggering constant upward comparison. This creates chronic feelings of inadequacy because the brain treats these comparisons as real benchmarks for success.

      Second mechanism: dopamine hijacking. Social media platforms use variable reward schedules—like slot machines—to keep users engaged. Every notification, like, or comment triggers a dopamine hit, creating addictive patterns that make it hard to disengage even when the experience is negative.

      Third mechanism: sleep disruption. Late-night scrolling suppresses melatonin production and overstimulates the brain. Poor sleep quality compounds mental health issues, creating a vicious cycle where social media both causes anxiety and becomes the coping mechanism for it."

   c) WEIGHING (within this argument)
      - Explicitly compare: probability AND magnitude AND timeframe
      - Explain why THIS argument matters in THIS specific motion/round
      - Force a clear comparison: "This outweighs because..."

   d) PRE-EMPTION (only when strategically necessary)
      - Name the likely pushback specifically
      - Frontload why it fails or why you still win even if it's true
      - Weigh against it

5. CONCLUSION (3-5 sentences)
   - Collapse the debate to the key question
   - Explain why you win on the most important layer
   - Drive home why the opposition's case cannot overcome yours

MANDATORY STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- SIGNPOST HEAVILY: Label everything clearly. "Our first contention is...", "Three mechanisms for this: first..., second..., third...", "Let me weigh this on two layers..."
- DEVELOP MECHANISMS FULLY: Each mechanism needs 2-3 sentences. Don't just list them—explain the causal chain, then elaborate with evidence or examples. This makes contentions substantial and persuasive.
- Zero filler. No "thank you for your time," no pleasantries
- Sound human, not robotic - vary sentence length and rhythm
- Use concrete numbers and real-world examples (things voters KNOW - Amazon, climate disasters, iPhone, not "study by XYZ institute")
- NEVER cite sources or say "as NYT reported" or "according to X" - just use the examples directly as common knowledge
- Make it sound like you're SPEAKING this, not reading an essay
- Be respectful but strategic - win through superior analysis
- When using CONTEXT: exploit the logical flow and evidence, but research and fill any gaps to make a complete case
